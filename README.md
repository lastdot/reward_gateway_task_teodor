Hi Reward Gateway team,

  I have chosen task 3 "Harden a default Linux distribution on a single node as you would run it on a
production environment. You should assume the presence of a web server
serving traffic on port 80."

  My solution to it:
    Run the Bash script "hardening_rg.sh" supplied in this repository as the root user on a default CentOS 7 installation. The script will harden the base installation and will also install and harden the Apache web server.
  
  Thank you for your time,
                    Teodor Kunev
